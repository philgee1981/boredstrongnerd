And what are better topics to talk about than the ones you know a little bit about or are at least interested?\nSo the idea is to talk about these things:\nNerdy stuff because I am a nerd. Though I suck at it one of my favourite pastimes are roguelike games such as Nethack or Angband.\nStrength-related stuff because I am interested in strength-related sport, i.e. strongman, powerlifting, armwrestling, sumo…\nand intersections of these topics such as looking at strength in numbers\nSo without further ado, lets start!\n\n\n\n",
