Hi! Since everybody needs a webpage I pondered (again ;)) about starting a webpage. And what are better topics to talk about than the ones you know a little bit about or are at least interested? 

So the idea is to talk about these things: 

- *Nerdy* stuff because I am a nerd. Though I suck at it one of my favourite pastimes are roguelike games such as Nethack or Angband. 
- *Strength-related* stuff because I am interested in strength-related sport, i.e. strongman, powerlifting, armwrestling, sumo...
- and intersections of these topics such as looking at *strength in numbers*

So without further ado, lets start!
